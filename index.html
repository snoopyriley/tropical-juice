                This is a simple project that I created to demonstrate the use of code blocks in HTML and CSS. 
                The code blocks are styled to look like a typical code editor with a header and body. 
                The code blocks are also responsive and will adjust to the width of the screen. 
                Feel free to use this project as a template for your own website or project.
