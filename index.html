            welcome to tropicaljuice.me, my new web project that i got a free domain name for, thanks to github education.

            this project is something i will be working on everyday for the rest of 2025.

            if you would like to suggest anything, feel free to let me know.

            if you want more information, i plan to use the <a href="https://github.com/snoopyriley/tropical-juice/wiki">wiki</a> to keep progress updates and feature releases.

            huge thanks to my friend emma for giving me the name of the website.
